# Co-teaching: Robust Training of Deep Neural Networks with Extremely Noisy Labels

This repository re-implements the code for Co-teaching, a new deep learning paradiam proposed by **Bo Han, Quanming Yao, et al**, using Python3.

## Coming Soon

1. CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 dataset.
2. Support for CUDA devices.
3. Extra experiment options.
4. A more detailed README.
5. Interesting findings from many experiments.

## Requirement

The following dependencies are the setup for this repository. However, the code itself can be run under many differerent settings. In case of failure, try out Python Virtual Environment.

- Python3 (v3.9.7)
- PyTorch (v1.13.1)
- TorchVision (v0.14.1)
- Numpy (v1.24.3)
- Tensorboard (v2.13.0)
